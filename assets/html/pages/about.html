    <div class="spacer-60"></div>
    <p class="lead">

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      As a recognized knowledge leader within the telehealth industry, SALUS’ innovation has led to the creation of a simple and easy-to-deploy model for bringing telemedicine to any market and putting it into practice quickly, efficiently, and in a cost effective
      way. This has led to services and systems that add value, improve quality, and reduce costs for our healthcare clients. Our comprehensive services truly set us apart resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for our partners. We are more than
      just a software or hardware company– SALUS solves the problem of effectively applying and integrating telemedicine technology and services into any healthcare environment, helping our partners increase the effiencies and capabilites of their current healthcare delivery system.

        <p class="lead">
          SALUS believes in appropriate interaction between a physician and a patient, which follows all medical board guidelines. This includes giving the physician the comprehensive ability to do a HIGH QUALITY "virtual" physical exam of the patient by incorporating the proper peripherals for primary care and most medical specialties. ​
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          In addition, the care must be provided at an appropriate location and—unless an exception applies—include the presence of qualified staff (also referred to as “patient site presenters”) to assist in the evaluation of the patient. Treatment and consultation recommendations made via telemedicine are held to the same standards of acceptable medical practices as those made in the traditional in-person clinical settings.

        <p class="lead">
          The hallmark of SALUS is our "open access" network which is a worldwide, encrypted, HIPAA-compliant web of access points that can connect hospitals and clinics to their own clinics and physicians and to other successful telemedicine programs in the Salus
          network. This allows our partners to maximize their telemedicine opportunities and to expand their telehealth and telemedicine services.
