      Comprehensive Telehealth Implementation
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer-60"></div>
    <p class="lead text-center">
      Salus offers a complete and comprehensive telemedicine program from equipment procurement, installation, training, and full service program support. Salus’ experience in implementing telemedicine programs includes many different domains such as hospitals, primary
      and specialty physician clinics, urgent care clinics, nursing homes, TPA stroke assessments, school clinics, correctional facilities, emergency departments, and child advocacy centers. For example, a hospital can contract with us directly to provide
      a comprehensive telemedicine program in telestroke, telepsychiatry, and numerous other healthcare specialties. We also have strategic partners that can provide additional services as needed.
      <br>
      <br> We bridge borders with the most extensive and robust telemedicine program in the United States and the world. Our tools and extensive network allow organizations to implement and support a comprehensive telehealth program for a fraction of the cost of developing an independent program from the ground up.
      <br>
      <br> With SALUS, our customers are never alone. Even beyond the launch of the program, you can depend on SALUS to be there when you need us, offering "best-in-class" customer service and ongoing support from our Account Managers, Customer Service Department and 24/7 IT Resolution Team.

            SALUS provides a facility and system assessment to determine strong areas of ROI potential and service usage. If you are considering this for your private practice or a major medical institution, SALUS can develop a conceptual framework for your organization
            that clearly defines where telehealth can be utilized to make a difference.

        <div class="accordion-content defualt-hidden">
          <p>
            The standards for e-clinical encounters will vary based on the nature of the patients and providers that will be accessing your telehealth platforms. SALUS's highly experienced team can assist in designing a custom suite of e-health enabled devices, networks
            and communications that will allow for a high-definition, personalized experience to take place.

        <div class="accordion-content defualt-hidden" style="">
          <p>
            The onboarding process of a telehealth initiative is dependent on the size and scope of the organization. Operational changes can take time, so establishing a relationship with those who are implementing must take precedence when integrating new systems
            and coordination of personnel duties. SALUS provides guidance to assist leadership during this process so that all questions can be answered in an efficient and timely manner.

        <div class="accordion-content defualt-hidden" style="">
          <p>
            Building a program from the ground up or expanding on an existing telehealth program requires the establishment of clear goals, objectives and evaluation strategies. In order for Telemedicine Program to be successful, it is highly recommended that it be built from within the client organization. Each Telemedecine Program that SALUS supports, is custom-tailored to meed the client's needs and design with a team focus in mind.
